Space-Time Correspondence as a Contrastive Random Walk


# TODO: 

1. I can create palindromes AFTER extracting feature maps for the first N frames, and generate palindromes of various lengths later: DONE

2. Complete visualization function: Done

3. Modify test cases: TASK FOR TOMORROW. GO THROUGH THE CODE, CHECK AND CONFIRM FLOW AND MODIFY THE TEST CASES: Done

4. Read the visualization papers: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6034, https://yosinski.com/media/papers/Yosinski__2015__ICML_DL__Understanding_Neural_Networks_Through_Deep_Visualization__.pdf, https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/, https://research.google/blog/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural-networks/, in that order
